# Anocare Litepaper

## Overview
Anocare is a decentralized health consultation platform designed to empower individuals with anonymous, private, and secure access to health professionals (AnoPros) using blockchain and AI technologies. By leveraging NFT-based identity, end-to-end encrypted health documentation, and anonymous AI health assistants, Anocare aims to bridge the gap between healthcare seekers and verified health practitioners, especially in under-resourced regions.

---

## Problem Statement
Millions of individuals worldwide, particularly in developing regions, face barriers in accessing quality healthcare due to fear of stigma, lack of anonymity, high consultation costs, and limited access to qualified professionals. Many avoid seeking help altogether due to privacy concerns or societal judgment, especially in sensitive areas like mental health and reproductive health.

---

## Vision
To create a privacy-focused, blockchain-powered platform where individuals can:
- Access qualified health experts (AnoPros) anonymously
- Consult AI health assistants for quick, private assessments
- Store and share encrypted health documents securely via IPFS
- Verify practitioner legitimacy through NFT-based credentials
- Receive transparent ratings on practitioner performance

---

## Core Features

### 1. **Anonymous AI Health Assistant**
Users can chat anonymously with a trained AI assistant that provides preliminary health guidance. It operates in private, non-custodial sessions without storing personally identifiable information.

### 2. **AnoPro Registration & Verification**
Practitioners apply to become AnoPros by submitting:
- License ID
- Proof of identity
- Specialization, region, and experience
- Encrypted documents (license and ID) stored on IPFS

The Anocare admin team reviews and verifies each application. Once approved, a VerifiedAnoPro NFT is minted to certify their identity on-chain.

### 3. **Secure Case Management System**
Users can:
- Request consultations with AnoPros anonymously
- Attach descriptions and symptoms
- Receive consultation fee breakdown
- Communicate through end-to-end encrypted channels

Practitioners can accept or reject requests. Payments are only processed if a case is accepted.

### 4. **Payment & Fee Splitting**
Payments are handled using an ERC-20 token (e.g., USDT or ANO token). The smart contract auto-splits the fee between the AnoPro and platform wallet.
- **Platform fee**: Default 10%
- **AnoPro fee**: Default 90%

### 5. **Premium Membership (AnoPass NFT)**
Users can optionally mint an AnoPass NFT to access:
- Free consultations
- Priority in matching with verified AnoPros
- AI-powered report summaries

### 6. **Rating & Reputation System**
After each closed case, users can rate their AnoPro. Ratings contribute to:
- Publicly viewable profiles
- AnoPro reputation scores
- Trust in platform integrity

### 7. **Encrypted Document Review**
Admins and delegates can decrypt submitted documents using Lit Protocol. This ensures:
- Only authorized personnel can view sensitive data
- Decryption keys are never stored on-chain
