# Anocare — Private AI Health Consultations on Web3

**Anocare** is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to provide private access to health consultations through AI and verified **AnoPros**—without collecting personal data or compromising user identity.

**AnoPro** (short for "Anocare Professional") refers to a verified healthcare expert on the Anocare platform. They are issued a blockchain-based credential (NFT) that allows them to consult with users securely.

This platform bridges the gap between trustless blockchain technology and trusted health care delivery.

## Why Anocare?

Most health platforms collect personal data, track usage, and often share that information. Anocare does not.

Anocare is built on the belief that healthcare access should be private, anonymous, and secure. Users are not required to give up their identity or history to receive help.

## What You Can Do with Anocare

- Chat anonymously with an AI-powered health assistant.
- Apply as an AnoPro and receive a blockchain-based NFT credential after verification.
- View and consult verified AnoPros with no central database tracking your interactions.
- Store files and activity history on decentralized storage using **Web3.Storage** or **w3up-client**—only if you choose to.

---

## Vision

We’re building toward a world where:

- Everyone can get private health advice anytime, from anywhere.
- AnoPros are verified with decentralized credentials (NFTs).
- Health history is optional, encrypted, and never collected without consent.
- The system is transparent, censorship-resistant, and community-owned.

## From the Creator

Anocare was not created as a trend or buzzword project.

It was born out of the need for people—especially in underserved communities—to access health advice without fear, judgment, or surveillance.

If you're a developer, supporter, grantor, or someone who believes in fair access to care, you're invited to help shape this platform.
