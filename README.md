# Anocare — Private AI Health Consults, Built on Trust and Web3

Anocare is an open-source decentralized application (dApp) that empowers users to consult AI privately and get referred to verified clinicians — **without compromising their identity**.

I am building a platform that bridges the gap between **trustless technology and trusted care**.

---

## Why Anocare?

Most health tech platforms store your data, track your usage, and sell your history.  
**Anocare doesn’t.** I believe access to health care should come with **autonomy and privacy**.

With Anocare:
- Users can chat anonymously with an AI health assistant.
- Verified clinicians receive NFT-based credentials to accept consultations.
- No centralized entity stores or controls your private health data.

We don’t just say “Web3 for good.” We’re living it.

## Vision

A world where:
- Everyone has access to **private health consultations**, powered by AI.
- Clinicians are **verified through decentralized NFTs**.
- Consult history is **opt-in, encrypted, or never stored**.
- The protocol is **transparent, community-driven, and uncensorable**.

## A Note from the Creator

> I am not building Anocare to make noise.  
> I am building it because people deserve **private access to support** — without surveillance or gatekeepers.

If you’re a developer, advisor, grantor, or just someone who cares — I invite you to build with me.
