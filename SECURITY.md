# Security Policy

At Anocare, user privacy and security are central to what we’re building. We believe everyone has the right to access health support without surveillance or data abuse.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly by following the steps below:

- Email: **yakubukarim12@gmail.com**
- Do **not** open a public issue. Instead, email us directly.
- Include as much detail as possible — steps to reproduce, potential impact, and any suggestions for a fix.

We will acknowledge your report within 3 working days and aim to investigate and resolve valid issues as quickly as possible.

## Scope

The following components are in scope for responsible disclosure:

- Smart contracts in this repository
- Frontend interactions (wallet auth, file encryption, data flows)
- API endpoints handling file metadata or user sessions
- IPFS interactions via `web3.storage` or `w3up-client`

## Out of Scope

- Issues relating to third-party dependencies
- Wallet provider bugs (e.g., Metamask, RainbowKit)
- Social engineering vulnerabilities
- DNS or hosting infrastructure outside our control

## Commitment

We appreciate community members who help keep Anocare safe. We’re building in the open and value ethical disclosures that help improve the project for everyone.
